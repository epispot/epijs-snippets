# Contributing Guidelines
Welcome to the contributing guidelines! You're here to start contributing, so let's not waste any time.

## First Steps

First fork the repo, and then run this:
```sh
bash scripts/build.sh
```
This will clone your forked repo, install dependencies, and give you info on how to go about the repo. Once you've installed everything, you can go and add your code snippet/JSON model to the repo.

## Need help?

Some good resources you should check out include:

 - The [docs](https://epi.js.org).
 - The [EpiJS Repo](https://github.com/epispot/epijs)
 - [Discussions](https://github.com/epispot/epijs-snippets/discussions)
 - [Issues](https://github.com/epispot/epijs-snippets/issues)

You should also check out the README of the folder your contributing to, such as `models/` which has instructions on how to contribute your model.
